        <p><strong> Normal calculator is a basic device used for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Key features typically include:<br>

            Display: Shows the numbers and results.
            Basic Functions: Includes buttons for digits (0-9) and operations (+, −, ×, ÷).
            Memory Functions: Often has memory buttons (M+, M-, MR, MC) to store and recall values.
            Clear Function: A button to reset calculations (C or AC).
            Power Source: Can be battery-operated or solar-powered.
            Normal calculators are commonly used in schools, offices, and homes for everyday calculations. They provide a straightforward interface for quick and efficient math tasks.</strong></p>
